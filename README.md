# Repository for DSCD Assignment
## Assignment 2
In this assignment we had to Sequential consistency using some stuff like gRPC and the book?? xD

run the following in the root directory when you git pull (for a contributor)
```sh
git config core.hooksPath "./git_hooks"
```
This is a pre-push hook so that untested code is not committed... atleast for pbbp


Reamaining tasks:
1. Add more test cases 
2. Never take dscd
