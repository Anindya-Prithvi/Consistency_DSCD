# Repository for DSCD Assignment
## Assignment 2
In this assignment we had to Sequential consistency using some stuff like gRPC and the book?? xD

run the following in the root directory when you git pull (for a contributor)
```sh
git config core.hooksPath "./git_hooks"
```
This is a pre-push hook so that untested code is not committed... atleast for pbbp


Reamaining tasks:
1. Check if quorum replicas tell other replicas
2. Print statements in test before submit
3. Correct interactive modes in quorum protocol (client mainly)
4. Add more test cases 
5. Never take dscd
